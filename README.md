# Multithreading Learning Repository

This repository is for learning multithreading in Java. It contains several packages associated with specific topics.

## Packages

+ concurrent: This directory contains examples of using basic Java Thread methods and thread states (how to create and
  start threads, set thread priorities and names, put threads to sleep, and interrupt threads).
+ async: This directory contains examples of using CompletableFuture methods to perform asynchronous operations (how to
  create and start asynchronous tasks, combine multiple tasks, execute a Runnable task after executing an asynchronous
  task).
+ cas: This directory contains examples of using Compare and Swap (CAS) operations in Java (how to use CAS operations to
  implement lock-free data structures and algorithms).

Tools:
